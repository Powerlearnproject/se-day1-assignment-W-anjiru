#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING is the process of developing solutions for problems in the real-world using computer technology.

IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IN TH TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY
1. Foundation of digital transformation - software engineering enables digital solution to be made such as web application, mobile apps and cloud based software.

2. Facilitate innovation and competitive advantage - In a competitive market, companies rely on high-quality, innovative software products to differentiate themselves.
   
3. Ensuring quality and reliability -software engineering emphasizes best practices in testing, quality assurance, and debugging to produce reliable, bug-free software. This is crucial for maintaining user trust and satisfaction.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Development of the programming languages like C language.
2. The establishment of software development as a discipline.
3. The rise of agile methodologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements - Involves gathering and documenting user needs and systems requirements.
2. Design - Invoves creating a high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation -Writing a code and building software according to the design specification.
4. Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standard and functional requirement.
5. Deployment - releasing the software to the users or customers.
6. Maintenance -Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software for deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology includes sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards while Agile methodology involves iterative and incremental approach.
Waterfall methodology examples of scenarios include fixed requirement projects.
Agile methodology examples of scenarios include dynamic and fast changing projects


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a software that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code.
An example of IDE is Visual Studio Code.
Version Control Systems (VCS) is a software tool for tracking changes to source code and  coordinating work among teams members.
An example of VCS is Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Changing requirement - One of the ways of overcoming this challenge is by having an effective communication among team members ensuring that everything required or problems identified can be communicated among the team thereby avoiding frequent changes to the requirement.
2. Tight deadlines - You can overcome this challenge by regular assessment of project goals and timelines to ensure that you are at per with the deadlines and also ensuring that you effectively have a good plan that gives a timely deadline which will not over work the team or put so much stress.
3. Technical Debt - Having a prioritization of tasks among the team will allow every member to have a task allocated to them there by avoiding shortcuts as well as allowing team 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing - This involves testing individual components or modules of software.

Intergration testing - This involves testing interaction between different components or subsystems.

System testing - This involves testing the entire system as a whole.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robort or AI assistant.

1.	Maximizing Model Efficiency: AI models rely heavily on input clarity to generate high-quality responses. Good prompt engineering helps the AI quickly understand what is required, maximizing its performance and relevance.
2.	Customization and Control: By refining the prompt, users can steer AI models toward specific outcomes, ensuring the output is tailored to their needs. This control is crucial in complex applications like content creation, programming, and decision-making.
3.	Reduces Errors and Misinterpretations: Poorly designed prompts may lead to misunderstandings, off-topic answers, or incomplete information. Effective prompt engineering minimizes these risks by providing clear guidance.
4.	Unlocking Advanced Model Capabilities: Many AI models have vast, sophisticated capabilities. By carefully structuring prompts, users can tap into deeper reasoning, creativity, and logic within the model, leveraging its full potential.
5.	Task-specific Optimization: Different tasks (e.g., summarization, translation, coding) may require different prompt formulations. Prompt engineering allows users to optimize interactions for specific domains, ensuring more accurate results.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about animals."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the key differences between mammals and reptiles, focusing on their biological traits and habitats, in a concise paragraph."

Why This Prompt is More Effective:
1.	Clarity - The improved prompt clearly specifies that the comparison should focus on mammals and reptiles, eliminating any ambiguity.
2.	Specificity - The user asks for information on specific biological traits and habitats, narrowing down the topic and guiding the model toward relevant information.
3.	Conciseness - The prompt asks for a "concise paragraph," setting expectations for the length and depth of the response.
4.	Structured Focus - By framing the task as a comparison of key traits, it ensures the output is organized and on-point.
